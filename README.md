# Accio.nft

Accio.NFT combines interchain bridging protocol with NFT marketplaces to create a one-click UX for buying NFTs with cross-chain liquidity.

## Background

- As the Ethereum ecosystem expands, we will see more and more new chains that serve different purposes.
- This means that in order to use multiple products, users need to move liquidity between multiple chains. The current UX for bridging liquidity is quite cumbersomeâ€”users need to swap and bridge tokens from each chain separately.
- There needs to be an easy way for users to use products without having to worry about how to bridge assets from different chains.

## Development

### Hyperlane
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/hyperlane-monorepo

We added the configs for the validator and relayer and have slightly modified the Hyperlane's relayer code to work with our use case.

#### Steps
The steps for building and running the binaries are specified in the [Hyperlane docs](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-hyperlane/run-validators). You can follow those steps with our modified [hyperlane-monorepo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/hyperlane-monorepo).

### Smart contracts
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-nft-contracts

The `buy` function on the `LiquidityAggregator` contract is the initial entrypoint that triggers the cross-chain liquidity aggregation and NFT purchase flow. It stores the user's request within the contract storage, fetches user funds on the local chain if needed, and sends interchain messages to the `LiquidityAggregator`s on the remote chains. Once the remote `LiquidityAggregator` receives the message, it gets the user's funds on the remote chain and calls `transferRemote` on the [`HypERC20`](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis-and-sdks/warp-api#interface) token to send them over to the origin chain. Upon a successful interchain transfer, the `handleWithToken` function on the origin chain's `LiquidityAggregator` is called and if the funds are all aggregated, an NFT purchase is executed.

#### Steps
1. Clone the [contract repo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-nft-contracts).
2. `yarn`
3. `hardhat compile`
4. `bash ./commands.sh`


### Frontend
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-frontend

#### Main Features
- Easily view liquidity across multiple chains
- Display the aggregated value of various tokens from multiple chains through the **1inch API**
- Support simple swaps across multiple chains using the **1inch Fusion SDK**
- Aggregate and display NFT collection information from multiple chains and marketplaces. Also used **opensea.io API**
- Integrated with the **accio.nft smart contract**
- View your NFTs distributed across multiple chains

#### Steps
1. Clone the [frontend repo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-frontend).
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn dev`

### Backend
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-backend

#### Main Features
- Periodically fetch and store NFT offer data from marketplace(opensea.io currently)
- Provide pre-fetched data upon request from the frontend

#### Steps
- To install 
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn nft_server:app --reload
```

- To request
```
http://localhost:8000/offers/{slug}
http://localhost:8000/stats/{slug}
```

### Disclaimer

- Due to the opensea API not functioning properly on testnets, the demo has been set up using mainnet data as a basis and mock test data has been created
- Since the 1inch Fusion API does not support testnets, this feature has been disabled in the demo
- As the 1inch Quote API does not support chains like Linea, this feature has also been disabled in the demo
