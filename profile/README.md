# Accio.NFT

Accio.NFT combines interchain bridging protocol with NFT marketplaces to create a one-click UX for buying NFTs with cross-chain liquidity.


## Background

- As the Ethereum ecosystem expands, we will see more and more new chains that serve different purposes.
- This means that in order to use multiple products, users need to move liquidity between multiple chains. The current UX for bridging liquidity is quite cumbersomeâ€”users need to swap and bridge tokens from each chain separately.
- There needs to be an easy way for users to use products without having to worry about how to bridge assets from different chains.

## Development

### Hyperlane
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/hyperlane-monorepo

We added the configs for the validator and relayer and have slightly modified the Hyperlane's relayer code to work with our use case.

#### Steps
The steps for building and running the binaries are specified in the [Hyperlane docs](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-hyperlane/run-validators). You can follow those steps with our modified [hyperlane-monorepo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/hyperlane-monorepo).

### Smart contracts
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-nft-contracts

The `buy` function on the `LiquidityAggregator` contract is the initial entrypoint that triggers the cross-chain liquidity aggregation and NFT purchase flow:

1. Stores the user's request within the contract storage
2. Fetches user funds on the local chain if needed
3. Sends interchain messages to the `LiquidityAggregator`s on the remote chains
4. Once the remote `LiquidityAggregator` receives the message, it gets the user's funds on the remote chain and calls `transferRemote` on the [`HypERC20`](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis-and-sdks/warp-api#interface) token to send them over to the origin chain.
5. Upon a successful interchain transfer, the `handleWithToken` function on the origin chain's `LiquidityAggregator` is called and if the funds are all aggregated, an NFT purchase is executed.

#### Steps
1. Clone the [contract repo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-nft-contracts).
2. `yarn`
3. `hardhat compile`
4. `bash ./commands.sh`


### Frontend
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-frontend

#### Main Features
- Easily view liquidity across multiple chains
- Display the aggregated value of various tokens from multiple chains through the **1inch API**
- Support simple swaps across multiple chains using the **1inch Fusion SDK**
  - Currently disabled for demo
  - See https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-frontend/pull/1 for fusion sdk implementation
- Aggregate and display NFT collection information from multiple chains and marketplaces. Also used **opensea.io API**
- Integrated with the **accio.nft smart contract**
- View your NFTs distributed across multiple chains

#### Steps
1. Clone the [frontend repo](https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-frontend).
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn dev`

### Backend
https://github.com/2023ethtokyoteam1/accio-backend

#### Main Features
- Periodically fetch and store NFT offer data from marketplace(opensea.io currently)
- Provide pre-fetched data upon request from the frontend

#### Steps
- To install 
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn nft_server:app --reload
```

- To request
```
http://localhost:8000/offers/{slug}
http://localhost:8000/stats/{slug}
```

### Disclaimer

- Due to the opensea API not functioning properly on testnets, the demo has been set up using mainnet data as a basis and mock test data has been created
- Since the 1inch Fusion API does not support testnets, this feature has been disabled in the demo
- As the 1inch Quote API does not support chains like Linea, this feature has also been disabled in the demo
